# Electron PostWoman

Electron PostWoman is a cross-platform desktop application for API testing, similar to Postman. However, it offers a unique two-way functionality:  
- **Client Mode:** Send requests (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.) to test your APIs.  
- **Server Mode:** Spin up multiple mock servers to receive and inspect incoming requests, including headers and body content.

The application is designed for developers who need an all-in-one API testing solution that supports both request sending and server-side debugging.
